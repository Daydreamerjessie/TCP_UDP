Ubuntu 22.04

I finished a UDP and TCP socket programming via UDP and TCP. Clients can send and receive messages continuously from the server.

servermain.cpp: recording information, implementing queries, making responses.

serverA.cpp/serverB.cpp: acting like backend server and can continuously response to queries and print the responses to the main server.

client.cpp: Clients can send requests to the main server.
